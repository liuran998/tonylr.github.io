<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

TESTING:I am now a PhD student (2022-) in Computer Science and Technology at Shanxi University, supervised by Prof. [Fang Yuan]([https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Ru-Li-14829601?_sg=VXNUDhg-exV6GUMTTzZ3UgEBy0zZa6hRgTd8V_oo4GZ0doGm9wp14Vo_rBLhkms1qfdWlJrEIZquUi0](https://www.yfang.site/curriculum-vitae)). Meanwhile, I am co-supervised by Prof. [Xiaoli Li](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/), who is affiliated with the Institute for Infocomm Research at A*Star, Singapore. Before that, I received my Masters in Analytics from Nanyang Technology University (NTU) in 2020.

My research focuses on machine learning for Knowledge Graphs, with particular emphasis on multimodal learning, few-shot relation learning, and meta-learning. I am deeply interested in leveraging advanced methods to improve knowledge representation and reasoning in graph-based models. Additionally, I explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT, Lama, and other state-of-the-art models to enhance machine understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Feel free to contact me by <a href="mailto:liuran_998@hotmail.com">email</a> if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me.

[Context-Aware Adapter Tuning for Few-Shot Relation Learning in Knowledge Graphs. EMNLP 2024](https://github.com/liuran998/RelAdapter)

Liu Ran, Zhongzhou Liu, Xiaoli Li, Yuan Fang.

- Knowledge graphs (KGs) are instrumental in various real-world applications, yet they often suffer from incompleteness due to missing relations. To predict instances for novel relations with limited training examples, few-shot relation learning approaches have emerged, utilizing techniques such as meta-learning. However, the assumption is that novel relations in meta-testing and base relations in meta-training are independently and identically distributed, which may not hold in practice. To address the limitation, we propose RelAdapter, a context-aware adapter for few-shot relation learning in KGs designed to enhance the adaptation process in meta-learning.

[Diversified and Adaptive Negative Sampling on Knowledge Graphs. Workshop GDMA 2025](https://github.com/liuran998/DANS)

Ran Liu, Zhongzhou Liu, Xiaoli Li, Hao Wu, Yuan Fang.

- Explainable multi-hop question answering aims to utilize multi-source intensive documents retrieved to derive the answer. However, it is challenging to model the importance of knowledge retrieved. In this paper, we propose LOG, a novel optimized retrieval method to discover more beneficial knowledge from a local-to-global perspective, facilitating multi-hop reasoning, notably for long-chain reasoning.
