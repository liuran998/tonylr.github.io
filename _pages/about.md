<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science and Technology at [Shanxi University](https://www.sxu.edu.cn/) (2022~), under the supervision of Prof. [Ru Li](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Ru-Li-14829601?_sg=VXNUDhg-exV6GUMTTzZ3UgEBy0zZa6hRgTd8V_oo4GZ0doGm9wp14Vo_rBLhkms1qfdWlJrEIZquUi0). In addition, I am co-supervised by Prof. [Xiaoli Li](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/), who is affiliated with the Institute for Infocomm Research at A*Star, Singapore.
Before that, I received my B.S. degree from Shanxi University in 2020, majoring in computer science and technology.

My research interests lie in the areas of self-explaining rationalization, multi-hop reasoning, and (large) language models. I am also deeply interested in computational linguistics knowledge such as FrameNet and WordNet.
I have published several papers in international conferences and journals, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additionally, I have participated in a natural language processing competition centered on interpretability, where I am honored to win the national first prize (champion) in China.

[AGR: Reinforced Causal Agent Guided Self-explaining Rationalization](https://yunxiaomr.github.io/)

**Yunxiao Zhao**, Zhiqiang Wang, Xiaoli Li, Jiye Liang, Ru Li.

<a href="../images/paper_agr.pdf">**Paper**</a> <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
<a href="../images/poster_agr.pdf">**Poster**</a> <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

- We propose a novel approach AGR (Agent-Guided Rationalization), guiding the next action of the model based on its current training state. We introduce causal intervention calculus to quantify the causal effects inherent during rationale training, and utilize the reinforcement learning process to refine their learning bias.
